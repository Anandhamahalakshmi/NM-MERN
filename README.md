Project Title: HOUSE RENT APP USING MERN
Team Members: Anandhamahalakshmi, Sasikala, Vigneshwaran V,
Vignesh V

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Purpose :	The House Rent Application is designed to simplify the process of renting homes by providing an intuitive, user-friendly platform for renters and landlords. It aims to connect renters with available properties, allowing landlords to list and manage their rental units efficiently. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for a scalable and fast solution. The core objective is to streamline property searches, enhance communication, and improve the rental experience for both renters and property owners.

Features :

User Authentication: Renters and landlords can securely register, log in, and manage their profiles with JWT-based authentication.

Property Listings: Landlords can add, update, and remove property listings with details like price, location, photos, and amenities.

Search & Filters: Renters can search for properties based on criteria like location, price, and size, with real-time filtering options.

Property Details: Renters can view detailed information about properties, including images and landlord contact details.

Responsive Design: The app is built with React, ensuring a mobile-friendly and responsive user interface.

Admin Panel: Admins can manage user accounts and moderate property listings.

Real-time Communication: Renters and landlords can communicate via messaging or contact forms for inquiries and negotiations.

Property Image Uploads: Landlords can upload multiple property images, enhancing listings.

Scalable and Secure: Built with the MERN stack for high performance, security, and future scalability.
ARCHITECTURE :

Frontend (React):

Component-based UI with React, using React Router for navigation.
State Management with Context or Redux.
Axios for API communication.
UI components from libraries like Material-UI. Backend (Node.js & Express.js):
Node.js as runtime, Express.js for API routing.
REST API with routes for user auth (JWT), house listings, and user profiles.
Middleware for authentication and error handling.

Database (MongoDB):

Mongoose for schema management.
Collections for Users, Houses, and Rentals.
Operations: CRUD for houses, user registration/login, rental agreements.
Indexing for better search performance (location, price, availability).



Setup Instructions:

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or higher) - For running the backend.

MongoDB - Local or MongoDB Atlas for the database.
npm or yarn - For managing dependencies.
Git - For version control and cloning the repository.

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Anandhamahalakshmi/NM-MERN.git cd house-rent-app
Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate to the backend folder (if separated): cd backend
Install required dependencies: npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend folder: cd ../frontend
Install required dependencies: npm install
Set up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root of the backend
directory with the following values: MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key PORT=5000
For frontend, you may also need a .env file:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Run the app:

Start the Backend: cd backend
npm start

Start the Frontend: cd frontend
npm start

Test the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and http://localhost:5000 for the backend API.
Folder Structure:

Client: React Frontend Structure:

The React frontend of the house rent app is typically organized into the following folder structure:
/src

/components	# Reusable UI components (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Listings)
/pages	# Components representing different pages (e.g., HomePage, ListingDetails, LoginPage)
/context	# Global state management using Context API or hooks (e.g., UserContext)
/services	# API calls and interactions with the backend (e.g., api.js)

/assets	# Static assets like images, icons, and styles
/styles	# Global CSS, SASS, or styled-components (e.g., global.css)
/utils	# Utility functions (e.g., date formatting, validation)
App.js	# Main app component

index.js	# Entry point of the application

Server: Node.js Backend Structure:

/server

/controllers	# Logic for handling requests (e.g., userController.js, listingController.js)
/models	# Database schema definitions (e.g., User.js, Listing.js, RentRequest.js)
/routes	# Express routes for different endpoints (e.g., userRoutes.js, listingRoutes.js)
/middleware	# Authentication and validation middleware (e.g., authMiddleware.js)
/config	# Configuration files (e.g., dbConfig.js, environment variables)
/utils	# Utility functions (e.g., emailSender.js, fileUploader.js)
server.js	# Entry point for the server and express setup
.env	# Environment variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret)
Running the Application:
Frontend (React App):

The frontend is built with React, and youâ€™ll typically run it with the following steps:
Navigate to the frontend directory (client): Open your terminal and navigate to the client directory where the React application is located:
cd client

Install dependencies (if you haven't already): If it's your first time running the project or you've cloned it recently, you need to install the required npm packages:
npm install

Start the React development server: Start the React app using the following command:
npm start

This will run the React development server on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified). The frontend will automatically open in your default web browser.
Backend (Node.js Server):

The backend API is built with Node.js and typically uses Express to serve API endpoints. To start it:
Navigate to the backend directory (server): Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the server directory:
cd server

Install dependencies (if you haven't already): Install the necessary npm packages for the Node.js backend:
npm install

Start the Node.js backend server: Start the backend server with the following command:

npm start

The backend server will start running on http://localhost:5000 (or the port defined in your backend configuration). This will handle all API requests (e.g., user authentication, property listings, etc.).

Authentication:
Authentication Process
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for stateless authentication in this app.
Upon user registration or login, the server generates a
JWT token that is sent to the client.
The token contains user-specific information (such as user ID) and an expiration time. This allows the client to authenticate subsequent requests.
Login Flow
User submits login credentials (email and password).
The server validates the credentials (checks email and hashed password in the database).
If valid, the server generates a JWT token and sends it
back to the client.
The client stores this token (typically in localStorage or
sessionStorage).
The client includes the token in the Authorization header of future requests (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>).
Token Storage and Use
Client-Side:
The token is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage on the frontend, ensuring that it persists across page reloads and sessions.
Server-Side:
On receiving an API request with a token, the server
verifies the token using a secret key.
If the token is valid, the user is authenticated, and the requested operation is allowed.
If the token is expired or invalid, the server responds
with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status.

Authorization

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) can be implemented to restrict access to certain routes based on the userâ€™s role (e.g., regular user, admin, property owner).
For example, only authenticated users can create or update
property listings, while admins can manage users and all properties.
Authorization middleware checks the role of the user
associated with the provided token before accessing certain routes.
Token Expiry and Refresh
JWT tokens have a short expiry time (e.g., 1 hour). When the token expires, the user needs to log in again.
A refresh token can be used to obtain a new JWT token
without requiring the user to re-enter credentials. This refresh token is typically stored securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie).
Logout
When the user logs out, the frontend clears the JWT token
from storage.
The server doesnâ€™t maintain session state, so logging out is handled entirely client-side.
